# 353 FINAL PROJECT
# Files Expected / Produced
    I only have one ipython/ Juptyer notebook (restaurants-file.ipynb) which can be opened via terminal using 
    'jupyter notebook restaurants-file.ipynb' in the same directory (please ensure this - cd if necessary) OR using Anaconda Navigator's Jupyter
    Notebook'. 
    After that, please run all cells (in sequential order - top to bottom) and ensure the amenities (.gz) file is in the same directory. 
    to get the desired plots (click on cell -> run all), dataframes and other # ouputs (There are no output files expected)
